So this should be my first blog post, well I shall try to ramble on a bit such that I can see how the style looks.

### In the beginning

I wonder when I first though I should make a blog, and why. I guess there are relatively few people who I can share the things I make with, and I can reach a wider audience.

### But what will your content look like

Well to be honest I dont really know for sure, but I imagine I will discuss the things I do and my working process. 
I already feel like ill have to fight the temptation to produce very long posts.

### And how will it be different to other blogs?

Again, I think my style will come though after ive written some posts. I dont think there is a specific thing I will do that I havent seen elsewhere but
I'm hoping I can make content presented an original way with a unique blend of elements that is worthwhile to read.
